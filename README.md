[h1]Gift It To Me[/h1]

This mod enables a player to gift units to other players (human and AI).

[b]Features[/b]
The intention of this mod is to be able to help out allies in need of units (or to strengthen an foe of your foe, proxy wars! XD)

Units can be gifted to other humans (multiplayer!), other AI civs and also to city states and (maybe) even free cities.
Use it at own risk of losing units to other players on purpose! XD

Since the modding engine does not allow direct change of "ownership", not all types of units are giftable.

[b]Giftable units[/b]
- All combat-type of units (land, sea and air)
- Religious units (AI kills em if it its not "their" religion though)
- Support units (medics, military engineer etc.)
- Builders (only giftable to major civs)
- Settlers (only giftable to major civs)
- Archeologists (only giftable to major civs)

Great people are not giftable!
BUT, you are able to gift civ-unique units to others! Hype!

[b]How to gift you might ask[/b]
Just move your unit into other players territory, and push the magic gift-button in the secondary unit actions panel (the thingy with the plus-symbol).

[b]Rules of Gifting[/b]
- Needs to be in an other players territory
- Religious units, settlers and Indiana-Jones cannot be gifted to city-states
- Levied units cannot be gifted
- Hungary needs to gift gold together with the combat-unit to suzerain city-states
- Cannot gift to players you're at war with
- Max. gifts per turn: 5
- Unit health must more than 90%
- AI will destroy gifted units if they cripple their economy

[b]Diplomatic actions/reactions[/b]
- If you gift units to a player who is in war, the enemy-civ will send you a warning as a notification to not support their enemies, if you ignore that and continue gifting units, they will denounce you, resulting in 25 grievance towards you.
- Gifting units to a AI major civ will have the same relationship effect as a "Favorable Trade" to them, you will receive a +10 opinion-boost (which decays). This is a hard-cap (by the engine), gifting additional units only brings that opinion back to +10.

[b]Good ideas we might want ;)[/b]
- Steeleydan -> Maybe count towards an envoy if gifting to a city state. For instance, 1 envoy for every 5 units gifted.
- Ghiaman1334 -> Let the CS gift you captured settlers if your suz.
- ChrisMartin -> Get envoys, but limit it for example for "first-world-units"-only
- Zur13 -> It would be great if you could give units to AI for some number of turns and after that receive it back if they are alive and maybe receive some gold as a maintenance for that period
- memphrite/BLÃ€de -> Would it be possible to gift units to CS when they are within the border and in the hex neighboring their border? (if not suz. you cannot gift)
- Clumsy -> See Zur13 idea + Maybe the unit recieves a free promotion too, or instead of the money.
- VeeDK -> How about a city state quest to gift a unit (a specific unit for that exact city state) and then recieve the mandatory envoy for completing said city state quest?
